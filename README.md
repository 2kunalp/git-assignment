This repository contains an analysis of monthly rainfall patterns in Oxford and Melbourne averaged from 1855 to 2015

Use the following code to first combine the datasets and run the analysis:

```
Rscript r-scripts/combine-data.R

Rscript r-scripts/make-plot.R
```

The two input datasets are in `data` and the resulting graphs and tables are in `outputs`.
